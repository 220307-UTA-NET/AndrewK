-- This is SQL
-- for comments

-- When nothing is highlighter, and we run/execute everything in the current query is run
-- you can select only a specific command, and only run that one

SELECT *
FROM Customer;
-- When you make a query to a DB, any result will take the form of a table

SELECT 'Hello World';

SELECT 2 + 2;

SELECT SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- USUALLY nothing in SQL is case sensitive
select 2 + 2;

-- Seimcolons are not a required end-line character. They are an end of operation/and of thought, and are not generally required.
SELECT 2 + 2

-- SELECT (Columns) FROM (Table)
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Address 
FROM Customer;

SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName, Address
FROM Customer;

-- Column Alias
-- Great for concatenating multiple columns together
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName, Address
FROM Customer;

-- Filtering with WHERE
SELECT *    -- Get this column
FROM Customer   -- From this table
WHERE LEN(FirstName) > 5;   -- For entires that meet this condition

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Country = 'Brazil' AND City = 'SÃ£o Paulo';

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerId = 10;

-- Aggregate functions
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Customer;

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM Invoice;

-- Other aggregate functions include MIN, MAX, AVG, etc.

SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total)
FROM Invoice
GROUP BY CustomerId;    -- GROUP BY gives us a way to group the results of an aggregate function by entries

SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total) AS Sum_Total
FROM Invoice
GROUP BY CustomerId
HAVING SUM(TOTAL) > 40
ORDER BY SUM(Total) DESC, CustomerId;

-- JOIN
-- Accessing more than one table to return the desired data

-- INNER JOIN
-- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
-- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
-- FULL (OUTER) JOIN
-- CROSS JOIN
